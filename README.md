# OdontoPro

A clear and easy-to-use odontology clinic manager app built with Modular, Mobx and Floor.

## Codegen

Everytime you change any DAO, entity or controller, you'll need to generate the static code with the following command:  
`flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

You can watch for changes and rebuild on the go using the command below:  
`flutter pub run build_runner watch`
